# Snapt
A portable BASH script to integrate the Debian/Ubuntu package manager, `aptitude`, with the openSUSE developed `snapper`. It is currently only functioning as a wrapper.

### Requirements
* bash
	* or simalar shell (like zsh or fish)
* aptitude
* snapper

That's it. No, really. And that's all that should be needed.
